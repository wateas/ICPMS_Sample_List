# ICPMS_Sample_List
This project makes use of VBA and python macros to create a sample list from a Laboratory Management Information System (LIMS) backlog.  The code is written to import sample information from a Labworks LIMS, but could probably be tailored to other types of LIMS.  The sample information is processed in various ways to create a coversheet, analyte lists, and a suitable sample list to be copied into the instrument software.

## Getting Started
If you don't have LIMS, I have provided a file "backlog.dat" with data that can be used for testing. Alternatively, the excel workbook "ICPMS_Sample_List" has a worksheet "TestData" with data that can simply be copied the the worksheet "Import" in the same workbook.
